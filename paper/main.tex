\section{Introduction}

Reproducing machine learning results in the field of health care is challenging. Many published research articles do not make code nor data available. Journals could require the inclusion of code in submissions, however most health care data is very strictly protected by law \cite{hippapro}.  

Various approaches to building data sets which simultaneously have scientific utility and comply with privacy laws.  Broadly speaking, these methods fall into two categories: anonymization and synthesis.  Anonymization methods attempt to keep as much of the "real" data as possible, whilst ensuring that person-specific data 





\section{Appendix: Legal References}
In the U.S., the primary law affecting health data privacy is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\href{https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html}{HIPAA}). 


Additionally, organizations desiring to perform biomedical and social, behavioral, and educational research are subject to Common Rule (\href{https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html#subparta}{45 CFR 46, Subpart A}) and/or the U.S. Food and Drug Administrationâ€™s regulations (\href{https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=faa4b2b2900a70fbcac4a773c9da0f0f&mc=true&node=pt21.1.50&rgn=div5}{21 CFR 50} and \href{https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=faa4b2b2900a70fbcac4a773c9da0f0f&mc=true&node=pt21.1.56&rgn=div5}{56}). Furthermore, the Common Rule established Institutional Review Boards which are responsible and the institutional level of safe guarding human subjects in any research.
